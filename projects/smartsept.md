## About
↑ [Back to top](#smartsept-app)

IoT based Hand Hygiene Compliance Monitoring Solution.

Smartsept is an enterprise B2B IoT project; I worked with a highly-motivated and skilled team of software, mechanics, and electronics engineers.

## Key Accomplishments

* Performed as a technical lead, designing and defining processes for other developers, also code reviews and production releases.
* Designed and Implemented a real-time monitoring/administration web application.
* Achieved end-to-end type-safety with `typescript`, `graphql`, `typegen`, and `prisma`.
* Created a fully dockerized development and production environment.
* Successfully installed a Linux server and virtualized environments using `docker-compose` and cloud infrastructure.
* Defined agile git branch strategy and workflow.
* Planed epics and user-stories for agile development.
* Implemented Robert C. Martin's clean architecture to separate business logic and infrastructure on the server-side.
* Achieve +120% memory efficiency on low-end devices by changing the serializing format.
* Ensured data/event transform reliability between low-end devices and cloud services on connection failure by introducing a multi-queue algorithm.
* Designed the smartsept design system, illustrations, and logo.
